When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Sometimes we need to coorperate with other people in a single task, we need to use a remote repository to work with others. For example,
I can create a new branch to work on my task, another workmate need to finish another part of the job in another branch. We can merge 
into one branch after we finished our tasks. For another example, I had just finished a part of the task in the company and went home. Then 
I can use the remote repository to syc my local repository through GitHub.
